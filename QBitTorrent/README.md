## About the Script  
This Docker Compose configuration will launch QBittorrent in Docker. It proves useful as installing BitTorrent or UTorrent directly on Windows is restricted. Even if there is a workaround, it may cease to work in future Windows updates. This script provides a handy alternative solution.  
It will pull a Linux-based QBittorrent image and initiate it within an isolated environment. The downloads and tracking data will be stored locally on your system, in the same folder where you keep the Docker Compose file. http://localhost:8080
